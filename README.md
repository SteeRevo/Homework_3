# Homework_3
Our project has a fire place particle system  
There are many imported objects that decorate the scene including the hidden clues and the tables that the clues rest on  
There is a controllable first person character  
There is a flashlight that flickers that follows the players movement  
There are 5 interactable "clues" hidden in the maze that the player must pick up to advance  
  - Book
  - Viola
  - Vase
  - Rusted Key
  - Knife
When all clues are picked up by clicking "e" on them, the exit to the maze will open up
