# Homework_3

This is our final project for CMPM 121. 

Our project has a fire place particle system.

There are many imported objects that decorate the scene including the hidden clues, the tables that the clues rest on, and many other decorations like furniture and paintings. 

There is a controllable first person character.

There is a flashlight that flickers that follows the player's movements.

There are 5 interactable "clues" hidden in the maze that the player must pick up in order to unlock the exit.  
  - A Book
  - A Viola
  - A small Vase
  - A Rusted Key
  - A Knife  
  
When all clues are picked up by clicking "E" on them, the exit to the maze will open up.  

Contains our base code, a short demonstration video, and both Windows and Mac build files.
